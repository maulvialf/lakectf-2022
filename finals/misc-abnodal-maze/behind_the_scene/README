solver.py solves the challenge
rules.txt was something we considered giving out, but didn't in the end (I regret not doing so)
nodes.py was used in designing the challenge
The rule for all non relay nodes was to forward to destination = c + previous node, with c being a constant offset.
My aim was to make players figure out the routing rule, and had several solves, but the challenge ended up being too guessy, and I'm sorry if you had a bad experience with it. 
One mistake I did was severely underestimating how bad the connection would be, with some teams having 4 seconds of latency, while I had done my calculations with 1s
