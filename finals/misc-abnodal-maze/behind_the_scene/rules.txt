The aim of the game is to find a path that goes through all the nodes. 
There are 2 types of nodes:
 - The relay nodes faithfully forward the path according to your directions
 - The other nodes deterministicly forward the path

Every attempt (aka connection) has a random setup and a (fixed) time limit. 

Level 0 and level 1 only differ in the size of the game
