gen.py creates both the challenge and a visual image that will be the target. This is done by taking the image in a clockwise spiral fashion, top pixel row, right pixel colomn, bottom pixel row, left pixel column, etc., then encoding each with one of 7 different img formats. Then we concatenate them, while corrupting them by chopping off the last two bytes.
solve.py produces an image, reversing the scrabling (as best as possible)
utils.py contains some helper functions and classes used by both.
my aim was to do an interesting challenge, showing off what image formats exist, whith a slight ctf twist (or should I say spiral?). This was inspired by ncutter, the defcon qual challenge. I hope you enjoy
