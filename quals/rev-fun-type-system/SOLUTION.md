## Flag

The flag is `KITTYCAT`, so the in the final file would have only this line changed:

Initial:
`type Flag = CharF =~: CharL =~: CharA =~: CharG =~: Checksum // keep the Checksum at the end`

Solved:
`type Flag = CharK =~: CharI =~: CharT =~: CharT =~: CharY =~: CharC =~: CharA =~: CharT =~: Checksum // keep the Checksum at the end`
